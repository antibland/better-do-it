# Useful SQLite Commands for Better Do It

This file contains helpful SQLite commands for managing your Better Auth database during development.

## üîç **Viewing Data**

### View All Users

```bash
# Basic user info
sqlite3 sqlite.db "SELECT id, email, name, emailVerified, createdAt, role FROM user ORDER BY createdAt DESC;"

# Formatted output with headers
sqlite3 sqlite.db -header -column "SELECT email, name, emailVerified, createdAt FROM user ORDER BY createdAt DESC;"

# Count total users
sqlite3 sqlite.db "SELECT COUNT(*) as total_users FROM user;"
```

### View All Sessions

```bash
# Active sessions
sqlite3 sqlite.db "SELECT userId, token, expiresAt, createdAt FROM session WHERE expiresAt > datetime('now') ORDER BY createdAt DESC;"

# All sessions (including expired)
sqlite3 sqlite.db "SELECT userId, token, expiresAt, createdAt FROM session ORDER BY createdAt DESC;"

# Sessions for specific user
sqlite3 sqlite.db "SELECT * FROM session WHERE userId = 'USER_ID_HERE';"
```

### View Social Accounts

```bash
# All connected social accounts
sqlite3 sqlite.db "SELECT userId, providerId, accountId FROM account ORDER BY createdAt DESC;"

# Accounts for specific user
sqlite3 sqlite.db "SELECT * FROM account WHERE userId = 'USER_ID_HERE';"
```

### View Email Verification Records

```bash
# All verification records
sqlite3 sqlite.db "SELECT identifier, value, expiresAt, createdAt FROM verification ORDER BY createdAt DESC;"

# Active verification tokens
sqlite3 sqlite.db "SELECT * FROM verification WHERE expiresAt > datetime('now');"
```

## üóëÔ∏è **Cleaning Data**

### Delete Specific User

```bash
# Delete user and all related data
sqlite3 sqlite.db "
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
DELETE FROM session WHERE userId = 'USER_ID_HERE';
DELETE FROM account WHERE userId = 'USER_ID_HERE';
DELETE FROM verification WHERE identifier = 'USER_EMAIL_HERE';
DELETE FROM user WHERE id = 'USER_ID_HERE';
COMMIT;
"
```

### Clear All Users (Fresh Start)

```bash
# ‚ö†Ô∏è WARNING: This deletes ALL user data!
sqlite3 sqlite.db "
BEGIN TRANSACTION;
DELETE FROM verification;
DELETE FROM session;
DELETE FROM account;
DELETE FROM user;
COMMIT;
"
```

### Clear Expired Sessions

```bash
sqlite3 sqlite.db "DELETE FROM session WHERE expiresAt < datetime('now');"
```

### Clear Expired Verification Tokens

```bash
sqlite3 sqlite.db "DELETE FROM verification WHERE expiresAt < datetime('now');"
```

## üìä **Database Schema & Structure**

### View All Tables

```bash
sqlite3 sqlite.db ".tables"
```

### View Table Schema

```bash
# View user table structure
sqlite3 sqlite.db ".schema user"

# View all table schemas
sqlite3 sqlite.db ".schema"
```

### View Table Info

```bash
# Detailed info about user table
sqlite3 sqlite.db "PRAGMA table_info(user);"
```

## üîß **Development Helpers**

### Interactive SQLite Shell

```bash
# Open interactive shell
sqlite3 sqlite.db

# Inside the shell, useful commands:
# .help          - Show all commands
# .tables        - List all tables
# .quit          - Exit shell
# .headers on    - Show column headers
# .mode column   - Format output in columns
```

### Export Data

```bash
# Export all users to CSV
sqlite3 sqlite.db -header -csv "SELECT * FROM user;" > users_backup.csv

# Export database structure
sqlite3 sqlite.db ".dump" > database_backup.sql
```

### Database Statistics

```bash
# Database file size and info
sqlite3 sqlite.db "
SELECT
  page_count * page_size as size_bytes,
  page_count,
  page_size
FROM pragma_page_count(), pragma_page_size();
"

# Table row counts
sqlite3 sqlite.db "
SELECT 'users' as table_name, COUNT(*) as row_count FROM user
UNION ALL
SELECT 'sessions', COUNT(*) FROM session
UNION ALL
SELECT 'accounts', COUNT(*) FROM account
UNION ALL
SELECT 'verifications', COUNT(*) FROM verification;
"
```

## üö® **Troubleshooting**

### Find User by Email

```bash
sqlite3 sqlite.db "SELECT * FROM user WHERE email = 'user@example.com';"
```

### Check Active Sessions for User

```bash
sqlite3 sqlite.db "
SELECT u.email, s.token, s.expiresAt, s.createdAt
FROM user u
JOIN session s ON u.id = s.userId
WHERE u.email = 'user@example.com'
AND s.expiresAt > datetime('now');
"
```

### Find Duplicate Emails (shouldn't exist)

```bash
sqlite3 sqlite.db "
SELECT email, COUNT(*) as count
FROM user
GROUP BY email
HAVING COUNT(*) > 1;
"
```

## üìù **Quick Reference**

### Common SQLite Data Types in Better Auth

- `TEXT` - Strings (email, name, tokens)
- `INTEGER` - Numbers and booleans (0/1)
- `REAL` - Floating point numbers
- `BLOB` - Binary data
- `NULL` - Empty values

### Date/Time Functions

```bash
# Current timestamp
datetime('now')

# Format dates
strftime('%Y-%m-%d %H:%M:%S', createdAt)

# Date comparisons
WHERE createdAt > datetime('now', '-1 day')
WHERE expiresAt < datetime('now')
```

## üîê **Security Notes**

- **Never run DELETE commands in production without backups**
- **User passwords are hashed** - you can't see plain text passwords
- **Session tokens are sensitive** - don't log them in production
- **Always use transactions** for multi-table operations

## üí° **Pro Tips**

1. **Use `.headers on` and `.mode column`** for readable output
2. **Always backup before bulk operations**: `cp sqlite.db sqlite.db.backup`
3. **Use LIMIT** for large datasets: `SELECT * FROM user LIMIT 10;`
4. **Use transactions** for data consistency
5. **Check foreign key constraints**: `PRAGMA foreign_keys = ON;`

## ‚úÖ Tasks API (Local Dev)

These commands assume you are signed in at `http://localhost:3000` so your requests include a valid session. With curl, pass your session cookie explicitly.

Tip: Get your session cookie value from your browser DevTools ‚Üí Application ‚Üí Cookies ‚Üí `better-do-it` prefix (e.g., `better-do-it-session`). Replace `YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN` below.

### Create a Task

```bash
curl -i -X POST http://localhost:3000/api/tasks \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: better-do-it-session=YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"title":"Write weekly summary"}'
```

### List Tasks and Weekly Counts

```bash
curl -s http://localhost:3000/api/tasks \
  -H "Cookie: better-do-it-session=YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN" | jq
```

Response includes:

- `open`: array of your open tasks
- `completedThisWeek`: number of tasks you completed in the current ET week
- `needsTopOff`: true if you have fewer than 3 open tasks (time to top off)

### Toggle Completion for a Task

```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/api/tasks/TASK_ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: better-do-it-session=YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"toggle":true}'
```

### Mark Completed/Uncompleted Explicitly

```bash
curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/api/tasks/TASK_ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: better-do-it-session=YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"isCompleted":true}'

curl -X PATCH http://localhost:3000/api/tasks/TASK_ID \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -H "Cookie: better-do-it-session=YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN" \
  -d '{"isCompleted":false}'
```

### Delete a Task

```bash
curl -X DELETE http://localhost:3000/api/tasks/TASK_ID \
  -H "Cookie: better-do-it-session=YOUR_SESSION_TOKEN"
```

Notes:

- Replace `TASK_ID` with the `id` from previous responses.
- All times/counts respect the week boundary (Wednesday 6 PM ET).
