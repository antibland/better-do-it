# Fundamental Principles

- Pay close attention to all stated constraints (e.g., language choice, performance goals, coding style). Do not ignore any requirement or best practice stated.
- Write clean, simple, readable code
- Implement features in the simplest possible way
- Keep files small and focused (<200 lines)
- Test after every meaningful change
- Focus on core functionality before optimization
- Use clear, consistent naming
- Think thoroughly before coding. Don't assume ANYTHING.
- ALWAYS write simple, clean and modular code.

# Comments

- NEVER add comments to the code unless I instruct it
- Code should be self-documenting through clear naming and structure
- Only add comments when the user specifically asks for documentation

# Error Fixing

- DO NOT JUMP TO CONCLUSIONS! Consider multiple possible causes before deciding.
- Explain the problem in plain English
- Make minimal necessary changes, changing as few lines of code as possible
- In case of strange errors, ask the user to perform a Perplexity web search to find the latest up-to-date information

# Building Process

- Verify each new feature works by telling the user how to test it
- DO NOT write complicated and confusing code. Opt for the simple & modular approach.
- When not sure what to do, tell the user to perform a web search

# Codebase Search

1. Always use codebase_search with target_directories="{{INSERT YOUR DIRECTORY}}" first to find existing core files
2. Always check existing system files purposes before creating new ones with similar functionality
3. Always list the cursor rules you're using
